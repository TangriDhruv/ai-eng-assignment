Chopped them in half (the larger ones chopped in 3's). Also instead of 2 tsp vanilla extract I did 1 vanilla 1 almond. They turned out perfect and so delicious! I made medium sized cookies (not small, not huge) and got 26 out of this recipe. They were so good I think I will do chocolate covered almonds, and vanilla & almond extracts next time too.",
