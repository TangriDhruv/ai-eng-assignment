I realized I left out the salt once all was mixed together so instead of adding it to the batter I sprinkled crushed sea salt on top of the cookies before baking. I like cookies a little bigger (the approx. size of my palm once baked) so baking time usually takes a little longer- I baked 'em 15 min instead of 10. They cooled firm but chewy with chips perfectly gooey. My husband loves them.",
